<b>Chaper 1 : Discover Your Calling</b>

When I was growing up, my father said something to me I will never forget, “Son, when
you were born, you cried while the world rejoiced. Live your life in such a way that
when you die the world cries while you rejoice.” We live in an age when we have
forgotten what life is all about. We can easily put a person on the Moon, but we have
trouble walking across the street to meet a new neighbor. We can fire a missile across
the world with pinpoint accuracy, but we have trouble keeping a date with our children
to go to the library. We have e-mail, fax machines and digital phones so that we can stay
connected and yet we live in a time where human beings have never been less
connected. We have lost touch with our humanity. We have lost touch with our purpose.
We have lost sight of the things that matter the most.
And so, as you start this book, I respectfully ask you, Who will cry when you die? How
many lives will you touch while you have the privilege to walk this planet? What impact
will your life have on the generations that follow you? And what legacy will you leave
behind after you have taken your last breath? One of the lessons I have learned in my
own life is that if you don’t act on life, life has a habit of acting on you. The days slip into
weeks, the weeks slip into months and the months slip into years. Pretty soon it’s all
over and you are left with nothing more than a heart filled with regret over a life half
lived. George Bernard Shaw was asked on his deathbed, “What would you do if you
could live your life over again?” He reflected, then replied with a deep sigh: “I’d like to
be the person I could have been but never was.” I’ve written this book so that this will
never happen to you.
As a professional speaker, I spend much of my work life delivering keynote addresses
at conferences across North America, flying from city to city, sharing my insights on
leadership in business and in life with many different people. Though they all come from
diverse walks of life, their questions invariably center on the same things these days:
How can I find greater meaning in my life? How can I make a lasting contribution
through my work? and How can I simplify so that I can enjoy the journey of life before it
is too late?
My answer always begins the same way: Find your calling. I believe we all have
special talents that are just waiting to be engaged in a worthy pursuit. We are all here
for some unique purpose, some noble objective that will allow us to manifest our highest
human potential while we, at the same time, add value to the lives around us. Finding
your calling doesn’t mean you must leave the job you now have. It simply means you
need to bring more of yourself into your work and focus on the things you do best. It
means you have to stop waiting for other people to make the changes you desire and, as
Mahatma Gandhi noted: “Be the change that you wish to see most in your world.” And
once you do, your life will change.

<b>Chapter 2 : Every Day, Be Kind to a Stranger.</b>

On his deathbed, Aldous Huxley reflected on his entire life’s learning and then summed
it up in seven simple words: “Let us be kinder to one another.”All too often, we believe
that in order to live a truly fulfilling life we must achieve some great act or grand feat
that will put us on the front covers of magazines and newspapers. Nothing could be
further from the truth. A meaningful life is made up of a series of daily acts of decency
and kindness, which, ironically, add up to something truly great over the course of a
lifetime.
Everyone who enters your life has a lesson to teach and a story to tell. Every person
you pass during the moments that make up your days represents an opportunity to show
a little more of the compassion and courtesy that define your humanity. Why not start
being more of the person you truly are during your days and doing what you can to
enrich the world around you? In my mind, if you make even one person smile during
your day or brighten the mood of even one stranger, your day has been a worthwhile
one. Kindness, quite simply, is the rent we must pay for the space we occupy on this
planet.
Become more creative in the ways you show compassion to strangers. Paying the toll
for the person in the car behind you, offering your seat on the subway to someone in
need and being the first to say hello are great places to start. Recently, I received a
letter from a reader of The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari who lives in Washington State. In
it she wrote: “I have a practice of tithing to people who have helped me along my
spiritual path. Please accept the enclosed check of $100 with my blessing and
gratitude.” I quickly responded to her generous act by sending one of my audiotape
programs in return so she received value for the gift she sent me. Her gesture was a
great lesson in the importance of giving sincerely and from the heart.

<b>Chapter 3 : Maintain Your Perspective.</b>

One day, according to an old story, a man with a serious illness was wheeled into a
hospital room where another patient was resting on a bed next to the window. As the
two became friends, the one next to the window would look out of it and then spend the
next few hours delighting his bedridden companion with vivid descriptions of the world
outside. Some days he would describe the beauty of the trees in the park across from
the hospital and how the leaves danced in the wind. On other days, he would entertain
his friend with step-by-step replays of the things people were doing as they walked by
the hospital. However, as time went on, the bedridden man grew frustrated at his
inability to observe the wonders his friend described. Eventually he grew to dislike him
and then to hate him intensely.
One night, during a particularly bad coughing fit, the patient next to the window
stopped breathing. Rather than pressing the button for help, the other man chose to do
nothing. The next morning the patient who had given his friend so much happiness by
recounting the sights outside the window was pronounced dead and wheeled out of the
hospital room. The other man quickly asked that his bed be placed next to the window, a
request that was complied with by the attending nurse. But as he looked out the
window, he discovered something that made him shake: the window faced a stark brick
wall. His former roommate had conjured up the incredible sights that he described in
his imagination as a loving gesture to make the world of his friend a little bit better
during a difficult time. He had acted out of selfless love.
This story never fails to create a shift in my own perspective when I think about it. To
live happier, more fulfilling lives, when we encounter a difficult circumstance, we must
keep shifting our perspective and continually ask ourselves, “Is there a wiser, more
enlightened way of looking at this seemingly negative situation?” Stephen Hawking, one
of the greatest physicists ever, is reported to have said that we live on a minor planet of
a very average star located within the outer limits of one of a hundred thousand million
galaxies. How’s that for a shift in perspective? Given this information, are your troubles
really that big? Are the problems you have experienced or the challenges you might
currently be facing really as serious as you have made them out to be?
We walk this planet for such a short time. In the overall scheme of things, our lives
are mere blips on the canvas of eternity. So have the wisdom to enjoy the journey and
savor the process.

<b>Chapter 4 : Practice Tough Love.</b>

The golden thread of a highly successful and meaningful life is self-discipline. Discipline
allows you to do all those things you know in your heart you should do but never feel
like doing. Without self-discipline, you will not set clear goals, manage your time
effectively, treat people well, persist through the tough times, care for your health or
think positive thoughts.
I call the habit of self-discipline “Tough Love” because getting tough with yourself is
actually a very loving gesture. By being stricter with yourself, you will begin to live life
more deliberately, on your own terms rather than simply reacting to life the way a leaf
floating in a stream drifts according to the flow of the current on a particular day. As I
teach in one of my seminars, the tougher you are on yourself, the easier life will be on
you. The quality of your life ultimately is shaped by the quality of your choices and
decisions, ones that range from the career you choose to pursue to the books you read,
the time that you wake up every morning and the thoughts you think during the hours of
your days. When you consistently flex your willpower by making those choices that you
know are the right ones (rather than the easy ones), you take back control of your life.
Effective, fulfilled people do not spend their time doing what is most convenient and
comfortable. They have the courage to listen to their hearts and to do the wise thing.
This habit is what makes them great.
“The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don’t like to do,”
remarked essayist and thinker E. M. Gray. “They don’t like doing them either,
necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose.” The
nineteenth-century English writer Thomas Henry Huxley arrived at a similar conclusion,
noting: “Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself
do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not.” And
Aristotle made this point of wisdom in yet another way: “Whatever we learn to do, we
learn by actually doing it: men come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp
players, by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just; by
doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled; and by doing brave acts, we
come to be brave.

<b>Chapter 5 : Keep a Journal.</b>

Maintaining a daily journal is one of the best personal growth initiatives you will ever
take. Writing down your daily experiences along with the lessons you have drawn from
them will make you wiser with each passing day. You will develop self-awareness and
make fewer mistakes. And keeping a journal will help clarify your intentions so that you
remain focused on the things that truly count.
Writing in a journal offers you the opportunity to have regular one-on-one
conversations with yourself. It forces you to do some deep thinking in a world where
deep thinking is a thing of the past. It will also make you a clearer thinker and help you
live in a more intentional and enlightened way. In addition, it provides a central place
where you can record your insights on important issues, note key success strategies
that have worked for you and commit to all those things you know are important to
achieve for a high-quality professional, personal and spiritual life. And your personal
journal gives you a private place to flex your imagination and define your dreams.
A journal is not a diary. A diary is a place where you record events while a journal is a
place where you analyze and evaluate them. Keeping a journal encourages you to
consider what you do, why you do it and what you have learned from all you have done.
And writing in a journal promotes personal growth and wisdom by giving you a forum to
study, and then leverage, your past for greater success in your future. Medical
researchers have even found that writing in a private journal for as little time as 15
minutes a day can improve health, functioning of your immune system and your overall
attitude. Remember, if your life is worth thinking about, it is worth writing about.
